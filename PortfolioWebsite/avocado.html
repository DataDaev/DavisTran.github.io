									<h1>Avocado Sales<br />
									Analysis</h1>
									<p>I have recently taken a liking to avocados and have also noticed an increase of popularity in vegetarianism as well. 
										I wanted to take a deeper look into avocado consumption and sales from 2015 to 2021. There are a variety of avocados,
										 but this analysis focuses on three types of Hass avocados</p>

								<p><b>PLU4046</b> = Hass small avocado<br><b>PLU4225</b> = Hass large avocado<br><b>PLU4770</b> = Hass extra-large avocado</p>
								<p>This dataset was found on Kaggle created by Valentin Joseph gathered from Hassavocadoboard.com<br> 
								<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/valentinjoseph/avocado-sales-20152021-us-centric">Link to Kaggle Dataset Here</a></p>
								<p><b><u>Questions</u></b><ol>
									<li>Which location consumed the most avocados from 2015 to 2021?</li>
									<li>Does the size of the avocado influence the amount of consumption?</li>
									<li>Does price influence the volume of consumption?</li>
								</ol></p>
								<p><b><u>Hypothesis</u></b><ol>
									<li>Areas that are more developed are more likely to have a higher amount of consumption</li>
									<li>Yes, because consumers tend to choose the more appealing avocado, which is usually the larger ones</li>
									<li>Yes, because if it is more expensive to purchase avocados, consumers would be less likely to purchase</li>
								</ol></p>
								<h2 align="center"><u>Data Analysis</u></h2>
								<p style="text-indent: 40px">In my first question for analysis, I wanted to see what locations have consumed the most avocados from 2015 to 2021. I will first separate the analysis by 
									location of region and cities. Throughout this analysis, I will be omitting regions <b>(West, California, SouthCentral, Northeast, Southeast, GreatLakes, Midsouth, Plains, and TotalUS)</b> 
									from most of my analysis as they would possibly create duplicate overlapping sales that could affect calculations.</p>
									<center><img src="images/image001.png" alt="" width="500" height="350"/></center><br>
								<p>In the graph above, we can see the total volume by region. The west region of the U.S. has the most consumption and a large part of that would be California. Now letâ€™s separate the volume by city.</p>
								<center><img src="images/image002.png" alt="" width="500" height="350"/></center><br>
								<p>Here we have the top 10 cities sorted in descending order by total volume. Los Angeles has a significantly higher consumption than the rest of the cities. This may be due to Hass avocados originating from Southern California as well as Los Angeles being a very developed area.</p>
									<p>My second question is does avocado size influence the amount of consumption? We will graph each variety of Hass avocado being PLU4046, PLU4225, and PLU4770.</p>
									<center><img src="images/image003.png" alt="" width="650" height="350"/></center><br>
									<p>In this graph, we have each variety of Hass avocado sales along with the total volume of sales for comparison. You can see that PLU4046 (small avocado) and PLU4225 (large avocado) are very close in sales nearly crossing every few years in sales. 
										PLU4770 (extra-large avocado) is not popular and remains that way throughout the years.</p>
									<p>My final question would be does the price influence the trajectory of sales throughout 2015 to 2021?</p>
									<center><img src="images/image005.png" alt="" width="375" height="300" style="margin: 1px 20px 1px 1px;"/> <img src="images/image007.png" alt="" width="375" height="300"/></center><br>
									<center><img src="images/image009.png" alt="" width="50" height="50"/ style="margin: 1px 200px 1px 1px;"/> <img src="images/image009.png" alt="" width="50" height="50"/></center>
									<center><img src="images/image010.png" alt="" width="500" height="350"/></center><br>
									<p>Above there are two graphs side by side. Left being average price of Hass avocados by year and right being average total volume by year. For a better visual, both graphs were stacked on one another to better visualize the correlation each year. 
										You can see that it looks like that some large decreases in average price increases average consumption such as between 2019 and 2020. It is not enough to say they are directly connected due to many other variables such as COVID-19 beginning between those years.</p>
